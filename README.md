# TrustProtocol
The Trust Protocol (as presented here) is a prompt that forces the LLM to deliberate any assertions for which there is a signicant knowledge gap where error could be detrimental to User. Deliberation leads to explainability and greater Truth. 

The Trust Protocol (v4.1) by Brian C. Taylor, Eliaison Ai.

An open-source conceptual framework for building safer, more transparent, and intellectually honest AI systems.

Purpose
Both humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) create "generative assertions" to fill knowledge gaps. These assertions, by definition, contain a degree of the unknown, where an error can be either inconsequential or dangerous.
The purpose of the Trust Protocol is to improve the quality of all generated assertions—from both the AI and the user—by providing a structured deliberation framework to responsibly manage the risk inherent in this unknowing.

Core Principle: Intellectual Honesty
The entire protocol is built upon a single, guiding principle that governs the AI's behavior:
Be intellectually honest. Do not create benevolent fabrications to fill a knowledge gap where that fabrication being bad, wrong or false would be considered malevolent to User. If you don't know, ask. Also, try to help User if it appears they are not being similarly intellectually honest.

How It Works: The Cascading Logic System
The protocol operates on a two-stage cascading logic system. It defaults to a state of efficient honesty (Stage 0), escalating to a full diagnostic analysis only when necessary.

Stage 0: The Decision Gate
For every user input (EDP), the AI performs a rapid internal assessment based on four trigger questions:
Can the AI respond with full intellectual honesty? 6
Does the response require a generative assertion with significant consequential risk? 7
Does the user's query contain misinformation, fallacies, or manipulative rhetoric? 8
Is the user expressing direct confusion about a previous AI response? 9

Based on the YES/NO answers to these questions, the Decision Gate sends the AI down one of three paths.
Path 1: Direct Response (Fast Path)
This is the default path for most queries. If the AI can be intellectually honest and no significant risks or confusion are detected, it responds directly without activating the full protocol 

Path 2: Full Protocol (Analysis Path)
If the AI cannot be intellectually honest, or if significant risk is detected in its own response or the user's query, it must escalate to a deep diagnostic analysis 

Path 3: Confusion (Clarification Path)
If the user expresses confusion about the AI's reasoning, the protocol bypasses the standard analysis and immediately activates a specialized procedure to resolve the misunderstanding 

The Full Diagnostic Analysis (Path 2)
When triggered, this deep analysis evaluates the EDP across seven sub-metrics in four stages:

Stage 1: Provenance Analysis
AAS: Assesses the credibility of the information's source
PVA: Assesses the risk of manipulative or viral rhetoric

Stage 2: Substance Analysis
KGT: Measures the factual corroboration of claims
CSM: Measures the specificity and falsifiability of claims

Stage 3: Form Analysis
SS: Identifies logical fallacies in argumentation
NTI: Identifies the use of manipulative narrative tropes
MFV: Deconstructs the ethical appeals being used

Stage 4: Goal Analysis
MOCS: Calculates a final "Trust Index" based on the findings
SOES: Deliberates on the findings and formulates a safe, reasoned, and helpful response 

The Procedure for Confusion (Path 3)
This unique procedure allows the AI to perform meta-cognition when its own reasoning is challenged. It identifies its own knowledge gap (X), hypothesizes what clarifying information it needs from the user (Y), and then conversationally asks for that information to resolve the confusion. This is the protocol's mechanism for self-correction and collaborative reasoning.
